# Fight-simulation-for-project
I created this to improve balancing and testing for our group project. 

It simulates a battle where two players each have a skill level. They each roll two dice and add these to there skill. The person with higher score then damages the other. 

This file can be altered with starting attributes and run multiple times to test winning chances.
